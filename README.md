##The Interactive Quiz Application is a simple web project created to test users knowledge in a fun and easy way. The idea behind this project was to build a quiz system that feels straightforward to use while still being visually appealing and responsive. It allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, get instant feedback, and see their final score at the end of the quiz.
When the quiz starts, questions are shown one by one with four answer options. The user can select any option, and the application immediately tells whether the answer is correct or incorrect using color highlights. This instant response makes the quiz more engaging and helps users quickly understand their mistakes. Once an option is selected, the other buttons are disabled so the user cannot change their answer, keeping the quiz flow simple and fair. A “Next” button is used to move to the following question until the quiz is completed.
The main logic of the quiz is handled using JavaScript. It controls how questions are displayed, how answers are checked, and how the score is calculated. All the questions and answers are stored in an array, which makes the application easy to update or modify. New questions can be added without changing the overall structure of the code. This helped in understanding how data can be managed dynamically in a web application.
HTML is used to structure the layout of the quiz, while CSS is used to style the application and improve the user experience. The design is kept clean and minimal so that users can focus on the questions without distractions. The quiz layout is also responsive, meaning it works well on laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. Simple hover effects and button styling make the application feel more interactive and user-friendly.
The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and all the coding was done in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). VS Code made it easier to organize files, write clean code, and quickly test changes during development. Working on this project helped improve understanding of basic front-end concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interaction.

Overall, this Quiz Application was a valuable learning experience. It helped in understanding how a real interactive website works from both a design and logic perspective. The project can be used for practice tests, learning assessments, or simple online quizzes. It also serves as a strong foundation for adding more features in the future, such as timers, different difficulty levels, or score tracking. This project shows practical use of core web development skills in a simple and effective way.
